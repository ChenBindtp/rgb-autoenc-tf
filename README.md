# rgb-autoenc rewrite in tensorflow 
Generative model of RGC cells (reimplementation in tensorflow). 

A tensorflow implementation of linear autoencoder NN trained on RGB images. 
See [the numpy / theano code](https://github.com/dvpc/rgb-autoenc). 
It was written after the 1st paper got rejected and i felt to reimplement the model in another framework to validate the findings.

# Requirements
Python 2.7  
Tensorflow et al from 2016 
## Note
Code is from late 2016, it needs some modifications to run today.
